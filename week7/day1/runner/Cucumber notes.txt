Pre-Requisite:
--------------
Cucumber Plugin and dependency:

<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
			<version>7.10.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
			<version>7.10.1</version>
		</dependency>
		
		
Feature -->describe the functionality 
Scenario -->describe the  particular of scenario to be tested

Given-->represent the preconditions
When -->represent the test Conditions
Then -->positive expected result


Create a class as StepDefinition under stepdef package
Create individual mnormal java method for each feature step
Add Annotations(@Given, @When @Then )on the top of every methos to map the feature file step with java method

Create a java class as RunnerClass under runner package

@CucumberOptions(features= {"src/test/java/features/TC001_Login.feature"},glue="stepDefinition")
public class RunnerClass extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests {

	//to execute the cucumber script
	//extend the runnerclass created under runner pkg with AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
	//use @CucumberOptions on top of the class-->map feature file and step def 
	//features=set the path of the featurefile to be executed
	//glue =set the stepdef
	
	
}


UndefinedStepDefinition -->exception -->missed any feature step to be implemented
DuplicateStepDefinition -->exception -->when feature step is implemented twice in java class

CucumberOptions
==============
features-->the path of the feature file
glue-->to connect or map the feature file step with the java class
monochrome -->to get the readable console--set the value as monochrome=true
publish- provide the html report

read the data from the feature file--> {string}
To send Multiple datas
Scenario Outline
Examples:
|username|password|
|'demoSalesManager'|'crmsfa'|
