  Steps to integrate Extent Report with POM
  ------------------------------------------
  Step:1  Create a method as startReport() in ProjectSpecificMethod
          Add first 3 lines of codes 
		  And annotate the method with @BeforeSuite
		  declare the ExtentReport as global variable
		  
 Step:2  Create a method as endReport() in ProjectSpecificMethod
			Add the extent.flush()
			Annotate the method with @AfterSuite

 Step:3 Create a method as testDetails() in ProjectSpecificMethod
         add the methods like createTest, assignAuthor,assignCategory
		 and annotate the method with @BeforeClass
		Declare the testName, testDesc, author, category as global variable

 Step:4 In Testcase -->setValues -->assign the values for testName, testDesc, author, category 
 
 Step:5 Create reportStep() with 2 arguments (msg, status) in ProjectSpecificMethod
		 to get the status of the script along with screenshot
		 
 Step:6 Call the reportStep() from each step method using try / catch
        - try block with pass status
        - catch block with fail status
 Step:7 Create a mathod takeSnap() and add the screenshot code  with filename appending with Random number
		- add return statement to give random number as output 
		
Step:8 Call takeSnap() from reportStep() to attach the image to the steps
